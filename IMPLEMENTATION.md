# DevProxy Browser Extension Implementation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the implementation of the DevProxy Browser Extension, which is a Chrome extension for listing and accessing local sites served by DevProxy.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Extension Structure

The extension follows the standard Chrome extension structure with Manifest V3:

- `manifest.json`: Configuration file for the extension
- `popup.html`: The main interface that appears when clicking the extension icon
- `popup.js`: JavaScript code that handles the functionality
- `styles/popup.css`: CSS styles for the popup interface
- `icons/`: Directory containing the extension icons

### 2. User Interface

The UI is designed to be compact yet functional, with the following components:

- **Header**: Contains the DevProxy logo, title, theme toggle, and help button
- **Main Content**: Displays virtual hosts grouped by domain
- **Loading State**: Shows a spinner while fetching data
- **No Hosts State**: Displays a message when no hosts are found
- **Help Modal**: Provides configuration instructions

### 3. Key Features

#### Theme Support

The extension supports three theme modes:
- Light theme
- Dark theme
- System theme (follows the user's system preference)

Theme preferences are saved in localStorage and applied consistently.

#### Auto-Refresh

The extension automatically refreshes the list of virtual hosts every 5 seconds. Users can:
- Pause/resume auto-refresh by clicking the refresh indicator
- See the current refresh status

#### Host Change Notifications

The extension monitors changes in the available virtual hosts and displays notifications:
- Shows notifications when new hosts are added
- Shows notifications when hosts are removed
- Displays the number of hosts changed and their names
- Clicking on a notification opens the extension popup

#### Collapsible Groups

Virtual hosts are grouped by domain and displayed in collapsible sections:
- Groups can be expanded/collapsed by clicking the header
- The collapsed state is saved in localStorage
- Groups are automatically collapsed when there are many hosts

#### Service Icons

Each host is displayed with an icon that represents its service type, determined by the hostname prefix:
- API services
- Frontend services
- CDN services
- Documentation services
- Admin services
- Mail services
- And more...

### 4. Data Handling

The extension fetches data from `http://localhost/vhosts.json` and processes it as follows:

1. Parses the JSON response
2. Groups hosts by domain
3. Renders the grouped hosts in the UI
4. Implements change detection to avoid unnecessary re-renders
5. Handles error states gracefully

### 5. Performance Considerations

- Minimal DOM manipulation
- Efficient change detection
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Compact CSS with CSS variables for theming

## Testing

To test the extension:

1. Load the extension in Chrome using Developer mode
2. Ensure DevProxy is running and serving virtual hosts
3. Click the extension icon to open the popup
4. Verify that hosts are displayed correctly
5. Test theme switching
6. Test auto-refresh functionality
7. Test collapsible groups
8. Test the help modal

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. Add a settings page for customizing the extension
2. Implement search functionality for filtering hosts
3. Add the ability to pin favorite hosts
4. Support for custom API endpoints

## Conclusion

The DevProxy Browser Extension provides a convenient way to access and manage local development sites served by DevProxy. Its compact interface and useful features make it a valuable tool for developers working with multiple local services.
